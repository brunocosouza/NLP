# NLP

The entire project is in **PORTUGUESE - BR**

This repository is a bunker where I register all my projects based on NLP models as well as models that can be used in NLP tasks (RNN, Transformer, etc).
All the techniques annotations that serve to explain step by step of the project are inside each project.

For simplicity, this repository can be useful to **study** and to **understand** the NLP models and tasks but it is not intended to be a NLP model repository.

The files inside Jupyter: The Dataset_for_Pretaining_Word_Embedding, Finding_Synonyms_and_Analogies and Pretraining Bidirectional_Encoder_Representations_from_Transformer(BERT) were made on Colaboratory, so the explanations are insider them

The projects are inspired at :
